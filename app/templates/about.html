                        Plant Sitting is a platform designed to help people care for their plants when they are away. We cater to students, travelers, or anyone who needs to temporarily leave their plants behind. Our service connects plant owners with responsible sitters who take care of their plants while they are gone. In return, the sitters receive compensation for their efforts. This creates a win-win situation where plants stay healthy and sitters earn extra income.
